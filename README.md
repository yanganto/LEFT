## Notes

The api need to be query with accept header, 
and the accept header is not suitable for flask-restplus framework.  
so I did a PR on this.  
[https://github.com/di/flask-accept/pull/8](https://github.com/di/flask-accept/pull/8)  
If there is any bug or issue, please kindly to tell me.  
Thanks.
